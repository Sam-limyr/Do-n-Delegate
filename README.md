## Guidelines for Hemanshu/Sam
Step 1 : Clone the repository.

Step 2 : Master branch is only for working code (ie do not push broken code on master). Instead, regularly push and pull                to/from the development branch instead. Ok to temporarily create more branches, which eventually merge with dev                branch.

Step 3 : Run "yarn install" every time you fetch from dev, to install node modules/expo/dependencies automatically on your              machine. The codes on github do not have these dependencies as the node modules file size is a couple hundred mb.              __Do not use "npm install" at all, stick to yarn.__
